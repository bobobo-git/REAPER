Renaming Childtracks --> ParentTrackname_ChildTrackname   (20180917)  
the brutal way, these two renames selected
tracks : results in *foldername_trackname* , it renames all selected tracks  
[!renchildtoparent.eel](scripts/!renchildtoparent.eel)  
[!bobobo_rename_child_track_append_parent.eel](scripts/!bobobo_rename_child_track_append_parent.eel)  

------

this renames selected tracks and renames like above only if the track is not a folder itself  
[!bobobo_rename_child_track_append_parent_if_not_parent.eel](scripts/!bobobo_rename_child_track_append_parent_if_not_parent.eel)  



-------

i freed the SLAX from SonicAnomaly from functions  
and duplicated a dialbutton to 8 of them (value1 to value8)  
  
as there is no real function but it is graphically responding  
you can do some parameter-modulation with other effects  
  
it uses the slax_gfx, so it's best to put it into the same folder  
as the Original SLAX ([reapack](https://reapack.com/) is obligate here  
and [SonicAnomaly's repository](https://github.com/Sonic-Anomaly/Sonic-Anomaly-JSFX/raw/master/index.xml)
