4 REAPER  

i freed the SLAX from SonicAnomaly from functions  
and duplicated a dialbutton to 8 of them (value1 to value8)  
  
as there is no real function but it is graphically responding  
you can do some parameter-modulation with other effects  
  
it uses the slax_gfx, so it's best to put it into the same folder  
as the Original SLAX ([reapack](https://reapack.com/) is obligate here  
and [SonicAnomaly's repository](https://github.com/Sonic-Anomaly/Sonic-Anomaly-JSFX/raw/master/index.xml)
