##Controlling InputFX from Track FX

someone had problems controlling input volume via envelope (an input fx has not too mcuh connect to the REAPERs guts)  
i made a controller script to deal with this  ( I salute the FX Builder of the original script )  
you get a volume slider in a trackFX  

[superior](scripts/VolumePan_Smoother_v5_special_superior)  
and a subordinate FX in Input FX  
[subordinate](scripts/VolumePan_Smoother_v5_special_subordinate.txt)  
sliding the volume in the track fx will dial the volume in Input FX as well.
