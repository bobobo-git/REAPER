a little tweak . i made 4 parallel Foilders so you can find the solely szf a bit more quickly i guess.

Put the content of [this zip](Virtual-Playing-Orchestra3-parallel.zip) beside the lib-folder

look at the [layout.txt](layout.txt) for closer information

you find virtual playing at (http://virtualplaying.com/) 

you have to get the sanmples from there
